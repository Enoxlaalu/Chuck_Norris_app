# Welcome to the Chuck Norris Jokes App.

This is a tiny app, but it's made by using all modern web technologies:

* React (React Hooks)
* Typescript
* Redux as state manager, because it's a very powerful tool which connects to React easily and have many useful features as middlewares
* Webpack as bundler, because it is very popular, flexible to config, working fast and stable
* Less as CSS-preprocessor, because it is easy to write css using its features as nesting, variables, importing etc.
* Babel
* Prettier
* Eslint

To run it locally, you should do only three easy steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`

And that's it! :)
